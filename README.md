## how it's made
1. Getting started. Created Git repo. Decided on frameworks. Set up the environment. 
```
npm init -y
npm install express mysql2 dotenv
```
2. Sorted out folder structure to keep the project organized and have a clear seperation of logic. 

3. Designed an ERD to visualize entities and relationships (not pictured). Translated to schema for MySQL. I am using MySQL Workbench to manage the database and test during development. Configured MySQL connection.
